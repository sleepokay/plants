A visualization of plant-like forms generated by Lindenmayer systems using the p5 library. 

An L-System consists of a seed string and a set of production rules which expand a symbol into a longer string of symbols. By repeatedly applying the production rules, we can generate a longer and longer string, whose recursive nature leads to self-similarity and fractal-like forms when we interpret the result of this process as a sequence of instructions for a graphical "turtle."

Example (from Wikipedia):
```
variables : A B
constants : none
axiom  : A
rules  : (A → AB), (B → A)
which produces:

n = 0 : A
n = 1 : AB
n = 2 : ABA
n = 3 : ABAAB
n = 4 : ABAABABA
n = 5 : ABAABABAABAAB

n=0:         A           start (axiom)
            / \
n=1:       A   B         the initial single A turns into AB by rule (A → AB)
          /|    \
n=2:     A B     A       A turns AB again, B turns into A
        /| |     |\
n=3:   A B A     A B     etc
      /| | |\    |\ \
n=4: A B A A B   A B A
```
